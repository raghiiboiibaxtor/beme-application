Updates to code 22.5.2022

-- loginform.svelte
Added a  'pop up error message' window.alert("You are already part of the team! :) ") if user already exist when trying to sign up.
Added a  'pop up error message' window.alert("!Woops! We don't recongnise the combination entered, please check your credentials and try again") if user entered the wrong credentials.

Played around with sign out - broke the app - put it on the back burner
Try to get the sign up page to re-direct to new form (not working) - user profile form has the code to enter users data.
